Mind Integrity Studios

This project is a creative full stack web application built with a custom React and Vite frontend connected to a Spring Boot backend API. I developed the core architecture using original code from a previous full stack application I built, and this version draws visual inspiration from the Three JS ecosystem for interactive web elements. The site is hosted on Lovable and functions as both a digital portfolio and resume that showcases my creative work and technical experience.

About the Creator

I am a self-taught painter and multidisciplinary creative professional with six years of experience working in fine art and digital media. I studied painting, drawing, sculpture, and Adobe Creative Suite at Purchase College and have produced commissioned pieces and gallery art, as well as design work for promotional content and social media.
